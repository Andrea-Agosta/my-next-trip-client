#My Next Flight

Web application for searching the cheapest flight for a specific route. 
The user can create an account and search a flight.

### Technology Used
For this application, I used React.js for the frontend side with [React  Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) framework.

### Installation:

After the `git clone` of the project cd in to project root folder.

Rename the file `.env-example` into `.env` and update the file with your data.
Rename the file `config-example.js` into `config.js` and update the file with your data.

Run in a terminal

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The application run on
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

### Future Implementation

- Login / registration Form;
- User page whit saved flight;
